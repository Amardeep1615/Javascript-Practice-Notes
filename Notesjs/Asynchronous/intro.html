1. setTimeout – Real-Time Scenario
Question:
In a food ordering app, after a user places an order, show a thank-you message 3 seconds
later to simulate a processing delay.



✅ 2. setInterval – Real-Time Scenario
Question:
In an online quiz app, create a countdown timer from 10 seconds. Display the time remaining
every second, and finally show “Time’s up!” when it reaches zero.


✅ 3. Callback – Real-Time Scenario
Question:
In a file upload simulation, write a function that accepts a callback. After simulating a
2-second upload delay, the callback should display “Upload successful!”


✅ 4. Promise (without fetch) – Real-Time
Scenario
Question:
Simulate a result generation system where the result is either “Pass” or “Fail” based on a
random score. Use a Promise that resolves or rejects after 2 seconds.


✅ 5. Game Starter Simulation (Using All
Concepts Together)
Question:
You are developing a mini browser-based game:
• Display a 3-second countdown using setInterval() before the game starts.
• After the countdown ends, wait for 1 second using setTimeout() to show “Game
Starting…”.
• Then, simulate a game result (Win or Lose) using a Promise after 2 seconds.
• Once the result is ready, call a callback function to display the final message:
“Congratulations, you won!” or “Oops, you lost!”
